# Convert a Unicode code point to UTF-8 bytes. Useful for generating UTF-8 bytes
# for use in a string in a C++ program, for example.
#
# Another usage is embedding Nerd Font characters in bash scripts <4.2, which
# doesn't support Unicode characters directly. For example, to embed the
# character at code point U+F240 in a bash script, you can use:
#
#  echo -e "\xf0\x9f\x8d\x80"
#
# Usage:
#
#   unicode_to_utf8_bytes f240
#

if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <unicode_code_point> (e.g., '\uf240' or 'f240')"
  exit 1
