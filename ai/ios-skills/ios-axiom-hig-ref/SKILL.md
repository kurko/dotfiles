# Apple Human Interface Guidelines — Comprehensive Reference

## Overview

The Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) define Apple's design philosophy and provide concrete guidance for creating intuitive, accessible, platform-appropriate experiences across all Apple devices.

### Three Core Principles

Every design decision should support these principles:

**1. Clarity**
Content is paramount. Interface elements should defer to content, not compete with it. Every element has a purpose, unnecessary complexity is eliminated, and users should immediately know what they can do without extensive instructions.

**2. Consistency**
Apps use standard UI elements and familiar patterns. Navigation follows platform conventions, gestures work as expected, and components appear in expected locations. This familiarity reduces cognitive load.

**3. Deference**
The UI should not distract from essential content. Use subtle backgrounds, receding navigation when not needed, restrained branding, and let content be the hero.

**From Apple HIG:** "Deference makes an app beautiful by ensuring the content stands out while the surrounding visual elements do not compete with it."

### Design System Philosophy

From WWDC25: "A systematic approach means designing with intention at every level, ensuring that all elements, from the tiniest control to the largest surface, are considered in relation to the whole."

#### Related Skills
- Use `axiom-hig` for quick decisions and checklists
- Use `axiom-liquid-glass` for iOS 26 material implementation
- Use `axiom-liquid-glass-ref` for iOS 26 app-wide adoption
- Use `axiom-accessibility-diag` for accessibility troubleshooting

## Color System

### Semantic Colors Explained

Instead of hardcoded color values, use **semantic colors** that describe the *purpose* of a color rather than its appearance. Semantic colors automatically adapt to light/dark mode and accessibility settings.

**Key insight from WWDC19:** "Think of Dark Mode as having the lights dimmed rather than everything being flipped inside out." Colors are NOT simply inverted—table row backgrounds are lighter in both modes.

### Label Colors (Foreground Content)

Four semantic label levels for text and symbols, each progressively less prominent:

| Style | Semantic Color | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `.primary` | `label` | Titles, most prominent text |
| `.secondary` | `secondaryLabel` | Subtitles, less prominent |
| `.tertiary` | `tertiaryLabel` | Placeholder text |
| `.quaternary` | `quaternaryLabel` | Disabled text |

```swift
Text("Title").foregroundStyle(.primary)    // Black in Light, white in Dark
Text("Subtitle").foregroundStyle(.secondary)
```

### Background Colors (Primary → Tertiary)

Background colors come in two sets — **ungrouped** (standard lists) and **grouped** (iOS Settings style):

| Level | Ungrouped | Grouped |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | `.systemBackground` | `.systemGroupedBackground` |
| Secondary | `.secondarySystemBackground` | `.secondarySystemGroupedBackground` |
| Tertiary | `.tertiarySystemBackground` | `.tertiarySystemGroupedBackground` |

Ungrouped: pure white/black in Light/Dark. Grouped: light gray/dark in Light/Dark.

```swift
// Standard list → ungrouped backgrounds
List { Text("Item") }
    .background(Color(.systemBackground))

// Settings-style list → grouped backgrounds
List { Section("Section") { Text("Item") } }
    .listStyle(.grouped)
```

### Base vs Elevated Backgrounds

There are actually **two sets** of background colors for layering interfaces:

- **Base set:** Used for background apps/interfaces
- **Elevated set:** Used for foreground apps/interfaces

**Why this matters:**

In Light Mode, simple drop shadows create visual separation. In Dark Mode, drop shadows are less effective, so the system uses **lighter colors for elevated content**.

**Example:** iPad multitasking:
- Mail app alone → base color set
- Contacts in slide-over → elevated colors (lighter, stands out)
- Both side-by-side → both use elevated colors for contrast around splitter
- Email compose sheet → elevated colors with overlay dimming

**Critical:** Some darker colors may not contrast well when elevated. Always test designs in elevated state. Semi-opaque fill and separator colors adapt gracefully.

### Tint Colors (Dynamic Adaptation)

Tint colors are **dynamic** - they have variants for Light and Dark modes:

```swift
// Tint color automatically adapts
Button("Primary Action") {
    // action
}
.tint(.blue)
// Gets lighter in Dark Mode, darker in Light Mode
```

**Custom tint colors:**
When creating custom tint colors, select colors that work well in both modes. Use a contrast calculator to aim for **4.5:1 or higher** contrast ratio. Colors that work in Light Mode may have insufficient contrast in Dark Mode.

### Fill Colors (Semi-Transparent)

Fill colors are **semi-transparent** to contrast well against variable backgrounds:

```swift
// System fill colors
Color(.systemFill)
Color(.secondarySystemFill)
Color(.tertiarySystemFill)
Color(.quaternarySystemFill)
```

**When to use:** Controls, buttons, and interactive elements that need to appear above dynamic backgrounds.

### Separator Colors

```swift
// Standard separator (semi-transparent)
Color(.separator)

// Opaque separator
Color(.opaqueSeparator)
```

**Opaque separators** are used when transparency would create undesirable results (e.g., intersecting grid lines where overlapping semi-transparent colors create optical illusions).

### When to Use Permanent Dark Backgrounds

**Apple's explicit guidance:**
> "In rare cases, consider using only a dark appearance in the interface. For example, it can make sense for an app that enables **immersive media viewing** to use a permanently dark appearance that lets the UI recede and helps people focus on the media."

**Examples from Apple's apps:**

| App | Background | Rationale |
|-----|------------|-----------|
| Music | Dark | Album art should be visual focus |
| Photos | Dark | Images are hero content |
| Clock | Dark | Nighttime use, instrument feel |
| Stocks | Dark | Data visualization, charts |
| Camera | Dark | Reduces distraction during capture |

**For all other apps:** Support both Light and Dark modes via system backgrounds.

### Creating Custom Colors

When you need custom colors:

1. **Open Assets.xcassets**
2. **Add Color Set**
3. **Configure variants:**
   - Light mode color
   - Dark mode color
   - High Contrast Light (optional but recommended)
   - High Contrast Dark (optional but recommended)

```swift
// Use custom color from asset catalog
Color("BrandAccent")
// Automatically uses correct variant
```

## Typography

### System Fonts

**San Francisco (SF):** The system sans-serif font family.
- SF Pro: General use
- SF Compact: watchOS and space-constrained layouts
- SF Mono: Code and monospaced text
- SF Rounded: Softer, friendlier feel
- Weights: Ultralight, Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold, Heavy, Black

**New York (NY):** System serif font family for editorial content.

**Both available as variable fonts** with seamless weight transitions.

### Font Weight Recommendations

**From Apple HIG:** "Avoid light font weights. Prefer Regular, Medium, Semibold, or Bold weights instead of Ultralight, Thin, or Light."

**Why:** Light weights have legibility issues, especially at small sizes, in bright lighting, or for users with visual impairments.

**Hierarchy:**
```swift
// Headers - Bold weight for prominence
Text("Header")
    .font(.title.weight(.bold))

// Subheaders - Semibold
Text("Subheader")
    .font(.title2.weight(.semibold))

// Body - Regular or Medium
Text("Body text")
    .font(.body)

// Captions - Regular (never Light)
Text("Caption")
    .font(.caption)
```

### Text Styles for Hierarchy

Use built-in text styles for automatic hierarchy and Dynamic Type support:

```swift
.font(.largeTitle)  .font(.title)       .font(.title2)
.font(.title3)      .font(.headline)    .font(.body)
.font(.callout)     .font(.subheadline) .font(.footnote)
.font(.caption)     .font(.caption2)
```

All text styles scale automatically with Dynamic Type.

### Dynamic Type Support

**Requirement:** Apps must support text scaling of at least **200%** (iOS, iPadOS) or **140%** (watchOS).

**Implementation:**
```swift
// ✅ CORRECT - Scales automatically
Text("Hello")
    .font(.body)

// ❌ WRONG - Fixed size, doesn't scale
Text("Hello")
    .font(.system(size: 17))
```

**Layout considerations:**
- Reduce multicolumn layouts at larger sizes
- Minimize text truncation
- Use stacked layouts instead of inline at large sizes
- Maintain consistent information hierarchy regardless of size

**Not all content scales equally:** Prioritize what users actually care about. Secondary elements like tab titles shouldn't grow as much as primary content.

### Custom Fonts

When using custom fonts:
- Ensure legibility at various distances and conditions
- Implement Dynamic Type support
- Respond to Bold Text accessibility setting
- Test at all text sizes
- Match system font behaviors for accessibility

**If your custom font is thin:** Increase size by ~2 points when pairing with uppercase Latin text.

### Leading (Line Spacing)

**Loose leading:** Wide columns (easier to track to next line)
**Tight leading:** Constrained height (avoid for 3+ lines)

```swift
// Adjust leading for specific layouts
Text("Long content...")
    .lineSpacing(8) // Add space between lines
```

---

## Shapes & Geometry

### Three Shape Types (iOS 26)

From WWDC25: "There's a quiet geometry to how our shapes fit together, driven by **concentricity**. By aligning radii and margins around a shared center, shapes can comfortably nest within each other."

#### 1. Fixed Shapes

Constant corner radius regardless of size:

```swift
RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12)
```

**Use when:** You need a specific, unchanging corner radius.

#### 2. Capsules

Radius is half the container's height:

```swift
Capsule()
```

**Use when:** You want shapes that adapt to content while maintaining rounded ends. Perfect for buttons, pills, and controls.

**Found throughout iOS 26:** Sliders, switches, grouped table views, tab bars, navigation bars.

#### 3. Concentric Shapes

Calculate radius by subtracting padding from parent's radius:

```swift
.containerRelativeShape(.roundedRectangle)
```

**Use when:** Nesting shapes within containers to maintain visual harmony.

### Concentricity Principle

**Hardware ↔ Software harmony:** Apple's hardware features consistent bezel curvature. The same precision now guides UI, with curvature, size, and proportion aligning to create unified rhythm between what you hold and what you see.

**Example of concentricity:**
```
Window (rounded corners)
  ├─ Sheet (concentric to window)
  │   ├─ Card (concentric to sheet)
  │   │   └─ Button (concentric to card)
```

### Platform-Specific Guidance

**iOS:**
- **Capsules** for buttons, switches, grouped lists
- Creates hierarchy and focus in touch-friendly layouts

**macOS:**
- **Mini, Small, Medium controls** → Rounded rectangles (dense layouts, inspector panels)
- **Large, X-Large controls** → Capsules (spacious areas, emphasis via Liquid Glass)

### Optical Centering

To preserve optical balance, views are:
- Mathematically centered when it makes sense
- Subtly offset when optical weight requires it

**Example:** Asymmetric icons may need padding adjustments for optical centering rather than geometric centering.

---

## Materials & Depth

### Standard Materials

Materials allow background content to show through, creating visual depth and hierarchy.

#### Four Thickness Options

1. **Ultra-thin** — Minimal separation, content clearly visible
2. **Thin** — Lighter-weight interactions
3. **Regular** — Default, works well in most circumstances
4. **Thick** — Most separation from background

**Choosing thickness:**
- Content needs more contrast → thicker material
- Simpler content → thin/ultra-thin material

```swift
// Apply material
.background(.ultraThinMaterial)
.background(.thinMaterial)
.background(.regularMaterial)
.background(.thickMaterial)
```

### Vibrancy with Materials

**Key principle:** Use vibrant colors on top of materials for legibility. Solid colors can get muddy depending on background context. Vibrancy maintains contrast regardless of background.

```swift
// Vibrant text on material
VStack {
    Text("Primary")
        .foregroundStyle(.primary) // Vibrant
    Text("Secondary")
        .foregroundStyle(.secondary) // Vibrant
}
.background(.regularMaterial)
```

### Liquid Glass (iOS 26+)

**Purpose:** Creates a distinct functional layer for controls and navigation, floating above content.

**Two variants:**

1. **Regular Liquid Glass**
   - Default, use in 95% of cases
   - Full visual and adaptive effects
   - Provides legibility regardless of context
   - Works over any background

2. **Clear Liquid Glass**
   - Highly translucent
   - No adaptive behaviors
   - **Only use for components over visually rich backgrounds** (photos, videos)
   - Requires dimming layer for legibility

**Modals & Sheets (iOS 26+):** Sheets, alerts, and popovers automatically adopt Liquid Glass with Xcode 26 — remove custom `.presentationBackground()` or `UIBlurEffect` backgrounds. System handles material, concentric corner radius, and morphing transitions. Use elevated semantic colors for modal content backgrounds, not Liquid Glass on the sheet body.

**Cross-reference:** For full Liquid Glass implementation patterns (sheets, alerts, popovers, morphing transitions), see `axiom-liquid-glass-ref`. For decision trees, see `axiom-liquid-glass`.

---

## Layout Principles

### Visual Hierarchy

**Place items to convey their relative importance:**
- Important content → top and leading side
- Secondary content → below or trailing
- Tertiary content → separate views or progressive disclosure

**From Apple HIG:** "Make essential information easy to find by giving it sufficient space and avoid obscuring it with nonessential details."

### Grouping & Organization

Group related items using:
- Negative space (whitespace)
- Colors and materials
- Separator lines

**Ensure content and controls remain clearly distinct** through Liquid Glass material and scroll edge effects.

### Content Extension to Edges

"Extend content to fill the screen or window" with backgrounds and artwork reaching display edges.

**Background extension views:** Use when content doesn't naturally span the full window.

```swift
// Content extends to edges
VStack {
    FullWidthImage()
        .ignoresSafeArea() // Extends to screen edges
}
```

### Safe Areas & Layout Guides

**Safe Areas:** Rectangular regions unobstructed by:
- Status bar
- Navigation bar
- Tab bar
- Toolbar
- Device features (Dynamic Island, notch, home indicator)

**Layout Guides:** Define rectangular regions for positioning and spacing content with:
- Predefined margins
- Text width optimization
- Reading width constraints

**Key principle:** "Respect key display and system features in each platform."

```swift
// Respect safe areas
VStack {
    Text("Content")
}
.safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom) {
    BottomBar()
}
```

### Align Components

"Align components with one another to make them easier to scan."

**Grid alignment:**
- Text baselines align
- Controls align on common grid
- Spacing is consistent and rhythmic

### Adaptability Requirements

Design layouts that:
- "Adapt gracefully to context changes while remaining recognizably consistent"
- Support Dynamic Type text-size changes
- Work across multiple devices, orientations, and localizations
- Account for different screen sizes, resolutions, and system features

---

## Accessibility

### Vision Accessibility

#### Text & Legibility

**Requirements:**
- Support text enlargement of at least **200%** (140% for watchOS)
- Implement Dynamic Type for systemwide text adjustment
- Use font weights that enhance readability (avoid Light weights with custom fonts)

#### Color Contrast

**WCAG Level AA standards:**
- Normal text (14pt+): **4.5:1 minimum**
- Small text (<14pt): **7:1 recommended**
- Large text (18pt+ regular, 14pt+ bold): 3:1 acceptable

**Implementation:**
```swift
// ✅ Use semantic colors (automatic contrast)
Text("Label").foregroundStyle(.primary)

// ❌ Custom colors may fail contrast
Text("Label").foregroundStyle(.gray) // Check with calculator
```

**High contrast mode:**
Provide higher contrast color schemes when "Increase Contrast" accessibility setting is enabled.

**Test in both Light and Dark modes.**

#### Color Considerations

**Critical:** "Convey information with more than color alone" to support colorblind users.

**Solutions:**
- Use distinct shapes or icons alongside color
- Add text labels
- Employ system-defined colors with accessible variants
- Test with Color Blindness simulators

**Example:**
```swift
// ❌ Only color indicates status
Circle().fill(isActive ? .green : .red)

// ✅ Shape + color
HStack {
    Image(systemName: isActive ? "checkmark.circle.fill" : "xmark.circle.fill")
    Text(isActive ? "Active" : "Inactive")
}
.foregroundStyle(isActive ? .green : .red)
```

#### Screen Readers

Describe interface and content for VoiceOver accessibility:

```swift
Button {
    share()
} label: {
    Image(systemName: "square.and.arrow.up")
}
.accessibilityLabel("Share")
```

### Hearing Accessibility

#### Media Alternatives

For video/audio content, provide:
- Captions for dialogue
- Subtitles
- Audio descriptions for visual-only information
- Transcripts for longer-form media

#### Audio Cues

Pair audio signals with:
- Haptic feedback
- Visual indicators

### Mobility Accessibility

**Touch targets:**
- Minimum: **44x44 points**
- Spacing: 12-24 points padding around controls

**Gestures:**
- Use simple gestures
- Offer alternatives (buttons alongside gestures)
- Support Voice Control
- Enable keyboard navigation

**Assistive technologies:**
- VoiceOver
- Switch Control
- Full Keyboard Access

### Cognitive Accessibility

#### Interaction Design

- "Keep actions simple and intuitive"
- Avoid time-based auto-dismissing views
- Prevent autoplay of audio/video without controls

#### Motion & Visual Effects

**Respect "Reduce Motion":**
- Minimize animations
- Avoid excessive flashing lights
- Support "Dim Flashing Lights"
- Reduce bounce effects
- Minimize z-axis depth changes

```swift
// Check Reduce Motion setting
@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion

var body: some View {
    content
        .animation(reduceMotion ? nil : .spring(), value: isExpanded)
}
```

#### Game Accommodations

Offer adjustable difficulty levels.

### visionOS Specific

Prioritize comfort:
- Maintain horizontal layouts
- Reduce animation speed
- Avoid head-anchored content (prevents assistive technology use)

---

## Motion & Animation

### Core Principles

**Purposeful Animation:** "Add motion purposefully, supporting the experience without overshadowing it."

**Avoid gratuitous animations** that distract or cause discomfort. Motion should enhance rather than dominate the interface.

### Accessibility First

**Make motion optional.** Supplement visual feedback with **haptics** and **audio** to communicate important information, ensuring all users can understand your interface regardless of motion preferences.

### Best Practices for Feedback

#### Realistic Motion

Design animations aligned with user expectations and gestures. Feedback should be:
- "Brief and precise"
- Lightweight
- Effectively conveying information without distraction

#### Frequency Considerations

**Avoid animating frequent UI interactions.** Standard system elements already include subtle animations, so custom elements shouldn't add unnecessary motion to common actions.

#### User Control

"Let people cancel motion" by not forcing them to wait for animations to complete before proceeding, especially for repeated interactions.

```swift
// ✅ Allow immediate tap, don't block on animation
Button("Next") {
    withAnimation(.easeOut(duration: 0.2)) {
        showNext = true
    }
}
// User can tap again immediately, not forced to wait
```

### Platform-Specific Guidance

#### visionOS

- **Avoid motion at peripheral vision edges** — causes discomfort
- Use fades when relocating objects rather than visible movement
- Maintain stationary frames of reference
- Avoid sustained oscillations (especially at 0.2 Hz frequency)
- Prevent virtual world rotation (disrupts stability)

#### watchOS

SwiftUI provides animation capabilities; WatchKit offers `WKInterfaceImage` for layout animations and sequences.

---

## Icons & Symbols

### SF Symbols

6,900+ vector symbols that match San Francisco font, scale with Dynamic Type, and adapt to Bold Text and Dark Mode automatically. Nine weights, three scales, four rendering modes, and 12+ animation effects.

> **For comprehensive coverage** of rendering modes (Monochrome, Hierarchical, Palette, Multicolor), symbol effects (Bounce, Pulse, Wiggle, Draw On/Off), and custom symbol authoring, see `axiom-sf-symbols` (decision trees) and `axiom-sf-symbols-ref` (complete API).

### Custom Interface Icons

**Design principles:** Recognizable, simplified designs with familiar visual metaphors. Maintain uniform size, detail level, stroke thickness, and perspective. Match icon weight with adjacent text. Adjust padding for optical centering when visual weight is asymmetric.

**Format:** Use **PDF or SVG** for automatic scaling. System components handle selected states automatically.

### When to Use Icons vs Text

From WWDC25: "A pencil might suggest annotate, and a checkmark can look like confirm—making actions like Select or Edit easy to misread. **When there's no clear shorthand, a text label is always the better choice.**"

**Use icons when:**
- Symbol has clear, universal meaning (share, trash, settings)
- Space is constrained
- Icon aids quick scanning

**Use text when:**
- Action has no clear symbol
- Multiple similar actions exist
- Clarity is more important than space

### Accessibility

**Always provide alternative text labels** enabling VoiceOver descriptions:

```swift
Image(systemName: "star.fill")
    .accessibilityLabel("Favorite")
```

---

## Gestures & Input

### Core Gesture Design Principles

**Consistency and Familiarity:** "People expect most gestures to work the same regardless of their current context." Standard gestures like tap, swipe, and drag should perform their expected functions across platforms.

**Responsive Feedback:** "Handle gestures as responsively as possible" and provide immediate feedback during gesture performance so users can predict outcomes.

### Standard Gestures

Basic gestures supported across all platforms (though precise movements vary by device):
- Tap
- Swipe
- Drag
- Pinch
- Rotate (iOS/iPadOS)
- Long press

### Touch Target Requirements

**Minimum touch target sizes:**

| Platform | Minimum Size | Spacing |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| iOS/iPadOS | 44x44 points | 12-24pt padding |
| macOS | Varies by control | System spacing |
| watchOS | System controls | Optimized for small screen |
| tvOS | Large (focus model) | 60pt+ spacing |

```swift
// ✅ Adequate touch target
Button("Tap") { }
    .frame(minWidth: 44, minHeight: 44)

// ❌ Too small
Button("Tap") { }
    .frame(width: 20, height: 20) // Fails accessibility
```

### Custom Gesture Guidelines

Custom gestures should only be implemented when necessary and must be:
- **Discoverable** — Users can find them
- **Straightforward to perform** — Easy to execute
- **Distinct from other gestures** — No conflicts
- **Never the only method** — Provide alternatives for important actions

**Warning:** Don't replace standard gestures with custom ones. Shortcuts should supplement, not replace, familiar interactions.

### Accessibility

**Critical:** "Give people more than one way to interact with your app." Never assume users can perform specific gestures.

**Provide alternatives:**
- Voice control
- Keyboard navigation
- Button alternatives to gestures

```swift
// ✅ Swipe action + button alternative
.swipeActions {
    Button("Delete", role: .destructive) {
        delete()
    }
}
.contextMenu {
    Button("Delete", role: .destructive) {
        delete()
    }
}
```

---

## Launch & Onboarding

### Launch Screens

**Mandatory for:** iOS, iPadOS, tvOS
**Not required for:** macOS, axiom-visionOS, watchOS

**Design principle:** "Design a launch screen that's nearly identical to the first screen of your app or game" to avoid jarring visual transitions.

#### Best Practices

**Minimize branding:**
- Avoid logos
- No splash screens
- No artistic flourishes
- Purpose: Enhance perception of quick startup, not showcase brand

**No text:**
- Launch screen content cannot be localized
- Avoid text entirely

**Match appearance:**
- Respect device orientation
- Adapt to light/dark mode

```swift
// Launch screen matches first screen
// Transitions smoothly without flash
```

### Onboarding

Onboarding is a **separate experience** that follows the launch phase. Provides "a high-level view of your app or game" and can include a splash screen if needed.

**When to use:** Only when you have meaningful context to communicate to new users.

**What onboarding can include:**
- Branding and splash screens
- Educational content
- Permission requests
- Account setup

**Timeline:**
1. Launch — System displays launch screen, transitions to first screen
2. Onboarding (optional) — Can include branding and education
3. Continued use — "Restore the previous state when your app restarts so people can continue where they left off"

---

## Platform-Specific Guidance

### iOS

**Tab Bar Guidelines:**
- Maximum 5 tabs on iPhone (6th+ go in "More" automatically)
- Every tab must have icon AND text label — icon-only violates HIG
- Always visible — don't hide during navigation within a tab
- Tab order reflects usage frequency (most-used on left)
- Maintain tab state: preserve scroll position and navigation state when switching
- iOS 26: Liquid Glass automatic — don't add custom blur/material backgrounds
- iPad: tab bar → sidebar in landscape; use `TabView` with `Tab` for adaptation

**Navigation Bar Guidelines:**
- Always use system back button (chevron) — don't replace with custom "X"
- Title describes current view content, not app name
- Large titles (`prefersLargeTitles`) for top-level views only; inline for pushed views
- 1-3 toolbar actions max; use `...` menu for additional
- iOS 26: Liquid Glass with toolbar morphing between views

**System integration:** Widgets, Home Screen quick actions, Spotlight, Shortcuts, Activity views

### iPadOS

Extends iOS with larger display, sidebar navigation, split view, pointer/trackpad, arbitrary windows (iOS 26+). Don't just scale iOS layouts — leverage sidebars and split views.

### macOS

Pointer-first, keyboard-centric. Dense layouts, smaller controls than iOS. Multiple windows, menu bar, contextual menus, keyboard shortcuts essential. Controls: Mini/Small/Medium → rounded rectangles, Large/X-Large → capsules.

### watchOS

Very small display — glanceable, minimal interaction. Full-bleed content, minimal padding, Digital Crown interactions, complications for watch faces. Always-on display consideration.

**Adapting from iPad/iOS:** Replace sidebars with page-based flow. Convert swipe/pinch to Digital Crown rotation. Use opacity/spacing for hierarchy (no materials/Liquid Glass). Complications replace dashboards. `@State`/`@Environment` reuse well; view hierarchy must be rewritten.

### tvOS

10-foot viewing distance, focus-based navigation, gestural remote. Large touch targets, prominent focus states, limited text input, directional navigation.

### visionOS

Spatial computing with glass materials, 3D layouts, depth. Comfortable viewing depth, avoid head-anchored content, center content in field of view.

---

## Inclusive Design

### Language & Communication

**Welcoming language requirements:**
- Use plain, direct, and respectful tone
- Don't suggest exclusivity based on education level
- Address people directly with "you/your" rather than "the user"
- Define specialized or technical terms when necessary
- Replace culture-specific expressions with plain alternatives

**Avoid phrases with oppressive origins** (e.g., "peanut gallery").

**Exercise caution with humor** — it's subjective and difficult to translate across cultures.

### Visual Representation

**Portraying human diversity:**
- Feature people demonstrating range of racial backgrounds, body types, ages, physical capabilities
- Avoid stereotypical representations in occupations and behaviors

**Avoiding assumptions:**
- Don't assume narrow definitions of family structures
- Don't assume universal experiences
- Replace culture-specific security questions with more universal experiences

### Gender Identity & Pronouns

**Best practices:**
- Avoid unnecessary gender references in copy
- Provide inclusive options: "nonbinary," "self-identify," "decline to state"
- Use nongendered imagery
- Allow customization of avatars and characters

### Accessibility & Disability

**Recognize:**
- Disabilities exist on spectrums
- Temporary/situational disabilities affect everyone

**Include:**
- People with disabilities in diversity representations
- Adopt people-first approach in writing ("person with disability" vs "disabled person")

### Localization & Global Considerations

**Prepare software for:**
- Internationalization
- Translation into multiple languages

**Cultural color awareness:**
- Colors carry culture-specific meanings
- White represents death in some cultures, purity in others
- Red signifies danger in some cultures, positive meanings elsewhere

**Use plain language** and avoid stereotypes to facilitate smoother localization.

---

## Branding

### Core Principles

**Voice & Tone:** Maintain consistent brand personality through written communication.

**Visual Elements:**
- Consider accent color for UI components
- Custom font if strongly associated with brand (but system fonts work better for body copy due to legibility)

### Key Restraint Guidelines

**Most critical guidance — restraint:**

**Defer to content:** "Using screen space for an element that does nothing but display a brand asset can mean there's less room for the content people care about."

**Logo minimalism:** "Resist the temptation to display your logo throughout your app or game unless it's essential for providing context."

**Familiar patterns:** Maintain standard UI behaviors and component placement even with stylized designs to keep interfaces approachable.

**Launch screen caution:** Avoid using launch screens for branding since they disappear too quickly; consider onboarding screens instead for brand integration.

### Appropriate Branding

**Do:**
- Use your brand's accent color as app tint color
- Include branding in onboarding (not launch screen)
- Use brand voice in copy
- Feature brand in content, not chrome

**Don't:**
- Display logo in navigation bar
- Override system backgrounds with brand colors
- Add splash screens
- Make branding compete with content

### Legal Consideration

Apple trademarks cannot appear in your app name or images—consult Apple's official trademark guidelines.

## Troubleshooting Common HIG Issues

### Color Contrast Failures

**Symptom:** App Store rejection for accessibility violations, or colors don't meet WCAG standards.

**Diagnosis:** Test with Accessibility Inspector, contrast calculators, both Light/Dark modes, and Increase Contrast enabled. See Accessibility > Vision section above for contrast ratio requirements.

**Solution:**
```swift
// ❌ Custom gray may fail contrast
Text("Label").foregroundStyle(.gray)

// ✅ Semantic colors (automatic compliance)
Text("Label").foregroundStyle(.secondary)

// ✅ Verified custom color (~8:1 on white, WCAG AAA)
Text("Label").foregroundStyle(Color(red: 0.25, green: 0.25, blue: 0.25))
```

### Touch Targets Too Small

**Symptom:** Users report difficult tapping, App Store accessibility rejection.

**Diagnosis:**
```swift
// Check button size
Button("Tap") { }
    .frame(width: 30, height: 30) // ❌ Too small
```

**Solution:**
```swift
// ✅ Expand touch target to minimum 44x44
Button("Tap") { }
    .frame(minWidth: 44, minHeight: 44)

// ✅ Alternative: Add padding
Button("Tap") { }
    .padding() // System adds appropriate padding
```

### Dark Mode Issues

**Symptom:** Colors look wrong in Dark Mode, insufficient contrast.

**Diagnosis:**
- Hardcoded colors that don't adapt
- Custom colors without dark variants
- Not testing in both appearance modes

**Solution:**
```swift
// ❌ PROBLEM: Hardcoded white text
Text("Label").foregroundStyle(.white)
// Invisible in Light Mode

// ✅ SOLUTION: Semantic color
Text("Label").foregroundStyle(.primary)
// Black in Light, white in Dark

// ✅ ALTERNATIVE: Asset catalog color with variants
Text("Label").foregroundStyle(Color("BrandText"))
// Define in Assets.xcassets with Light/Dark variants
```

### Light Font Weight Legibility

**Symptom:** Text hard to read, especially at small sizes or in bright lighting.

**Diagnosis:**
```swift
Text("Headline")
    .font(.system(size: 17, weight: .ultralight)) // ❌ Too light
```

**Solution:**
```swift
// ✅ Use Regular minimum
Text("Headline")
    .font(.system(size: 17, weight: .regular))

// ✅ Better: Use system text styles
Text("Headline")
    .font(.headline) // Automatically uses appropriate weight
```

### Dynamic Type Not Working

**Symptom:** Text doesn't scale when user changes text size in Settings.

```swift
// ❌ Fixed size doesn't scale
Text("Label").font(.system(size: 17))

// ✅ Text styles scale automatically
Text("Label").font(.body)

// ✅ Custom font with scaling
Text("Label").font(.custom("CustomFont", size: 17, relativeTo: .body))
```

### Reduce Motion Not Respected

**Symptom:** Users with motion sensitivity experience discomfort.

**Diagnosis:**
- Animations always play regardless of setting
- No alternative for motion-sensitive users

**Solution:**
```swift
// ✅ Check Reduce Motion setting
@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion

var body: some View {
    content
        .animation(reduceMotion ? nil : .spring(), value: isExpanded)
}

// ✅ Alternative: Simpler animation
.animation(reduceMotion ? .linear(duration: 0.1) : .spring(), value: isExpanded)
```

### VoiceOver Labels Missing

**Symptom:** VoiceOver announces unhelpful information like "Button" instead of action.

**Diagnosis:**
```swift
// ❌ Image button without label
Button {
    share()
} label: {
    Image(systemName: "square.and.arrow.up")
}
// VoiceOver says: "Button"
```

**Solution:**
```swift
// ✅ Add accessibility label
Button {
    share()
} label: {
    Image(systemName: "square.and.arrow.up")
}
.accessibilityLabel("Share")
// VoiceOver says: "Share, Button"
```

### Information Only Conveyed by Color

**Symptom:** Colorblind users can't distinguish status.

**Diagnosis:**
```swift
// ❌ Only color indicates state
Circle()
    .fill(isComplete ? .green : .red)
```

**Solution:**
```swift
// ✅ Use shape + color + text
HStack {
    Image(systemName: isComplete ? "checkmark.circle.fill" : "xmark.circle.fill")
    Text(isComplete ? "Complete" : "Incomplete")
}
.foregroundStyle(isComplete ? .green : .red)
```

### Launch Screen Branding Rejection

**Symptom:** App Store rejects launch screen with logo or text.

**Diagnosis:**
- Launch screen contains branding elements
- Launch screen has text that can't be localized

**Solution:**
```swift
// ❌ Launch screen with logo (rejected)
// Launch.storyboard contains app logo

// ✅ Launch screen matches first screen (approved)
// Launch.storyboard shows same background/layout as first screen
// No text, no logos, minimal branding

// Move branding to onboarding screen instead
```

### Custom Appearance Toggle Issues

**Symptom:** Users confused by app-specific dark mode setting, double settings.

**Diagnosis:**
- App has its own Light/Dark toggle
- Conflicts with system Settings → Display & Brightness

**Solution:**
```swift
// ❌ App-specific appearance toggle
.preferredColorScheme(userPreference == .dark ? .dark : .light)

// ✅ Respect system preference
// Remove custom toggle, use system preference
// Let iOS Settings control appearance
```
